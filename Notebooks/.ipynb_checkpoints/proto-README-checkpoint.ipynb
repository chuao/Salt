    "Subsurface salt is a blessing and a curse for Oil and Gas exploration and production. In one hand salt intrusions help creating and sealing oil and gas traps that can be very prolific. In the other hand there are many hazards related to drilling through or near salt domes.\n",

    "Reflection Seismic Imaging is used to determine structural and stratigraphic characteristics of the subsurface, it works by recording sound waves as they reflect from the different geological interfaces they found along their path. This technique relies heavily on some properties of the velocities at which the sound travels through the rocks. Salt however, stretches those assumptions reducing the ability for geophysicists to properly image them precisely.\n",
